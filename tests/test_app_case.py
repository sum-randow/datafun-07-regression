"""Smoke test for the example module(s).

WHY a smoke test:
    A smoke test does NOT check that the analysis is correct.
    It checks the cheapest, most important thing: does the file load at all?
    A typo, a bad import, or a syntax error stops a module from importing,
    and this test catches that, before anything else can run.


WHY it does not name the module:
    The brittle way is `from datafun import app_case`.
    That breaks the moment the module gets renamed.
    This test DISCOVERS the example module by
    naming convention since my example scripts end in `case`
    (app_case, app_co2_case, app_penguins_case, ...).

In practice, we provide unit tests to ensure each function is working
as we intended.

Just knowing about testing is a valuable skill.
Feel free to experiment with adding additional tests to this file,
or adding additional files.
Nothing regarding testing is required.
